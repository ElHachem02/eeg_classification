# EEG-Transformer
A ViT based transformer applied on multi-channel time-series EEG data for motor imagery classification. This repo is part of the final project for COGS 189: Brain Computer Interfaces at the University of California, San Diego, Winter 2022. This code repository and the project is managed and developed by Colin Wang, and several possible directions to improve the baseline model are proposed by Xing Hong, Luning Yang, Annie Fan, Yunyi Huang, and Zixin Ma.

The repository contains code that is highly experimental. Many arguments are hardcoded and the data is not carefully pre-processed. Use with caution. **If you are developing a research project inspired by this repo, please send me an email:** ziruiw2000@gmail.com and cc it to ziw029@ucsd.edu
